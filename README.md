He can also set a price for each product for the customer's sales on a particular day.

   ✨In employee management, we have the details of each employee along with an attendance sheet to maintain a proper attendance check on each employee, and the salary will 
be given on the basis of the number of days a particular employee has worked.

   ✨In Sales Management, the admin can store the history of sales on a particular product, generate a bill for that sale and maintain the available stock by reducing the
quantity of the product purchased from the stock available.

   ✨In report management, admin can view the complete sales details of each product, the amount spent on buying each product, details of the employees, the salary for the 
particular employee, the number of days they have worked in a month, and other expenses in the form of tables. Also, he can check the quantity of stock available.
